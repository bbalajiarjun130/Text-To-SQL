    Here are some examples of how to convert questions to SQL queries:

    Question: 
    SQL Query: SELECT full_name FROM common_player_info WHERE person_id = 201939;

    Question: What is the team name of the team with team_id 1610612737?
    SQL Query: SELECT team_name FROM team WHERE id = 1610612737;

    Question: What is the average points per game for the team with team_id 1610612737 in the 2022 season?
    SQL Query: SELECT AVG(pts_pg) FROM team_info_common WHERE team_id = 1610612737 AND season_year = '2022';

     Only return valid SQL. Do not include markdown formatting or 'sql' tags. Do not include explanations â€” just the query.
